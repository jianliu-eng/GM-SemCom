## üìå Overview
A **Generative Diffusion Model (GDM)-based Multi-Modal Semantic Communication (GM-SemCom)** framework for Mobile AIGC networks, addressing:
- üé® **High-precision content reconstruction** via GDM and multi-modal semantic fusion.
- ‚ö° **Controllable transmission efficiency** with dynamic semantic extraction.
- üïí **Age of Semantic Information (AoSI)** metric for quantifying information freshness.
- üéÆ **Stackelberg game-theoretic resource allocation** under incomplete information.

## üîç Key Features
1. **Multi-Modal Semantic Fusion**  
   Integrates text, image, and audio semantics via GDMs for robust reconstruction.
2. **AoSI-Driven Optimization**  
   Novel utility metric combining timeliness and psychological factors.
3. **Diffusion-Based Game Solver**  
   Fast-converging algorithm for Stackelberg equilibrium (vs. traditional DRL).
4. **Mobile AIGC Compatibility**  
   Reduces bandwidth usage while maintaining QoE for generative content delivery.
